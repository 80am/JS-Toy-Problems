# HEY DOUG!!!!

The intro and medium folders are just random toy problems that I have collected but are not relly part of my new plan specifically

## HTML

The HTML has a few sites drawn with boxes around them progressing through how to build a layout and more importantly how to think in terms of boxes and sections. If you use this I would stress that they should really just use divs and not worry about the actual content but more the layout and how to position things.

## Cart

The idea of this one was to try and spend multiple days spread over a few weeks where they built something that felt more real and usable. Also this would help for when students want to build a cart and now you could have them pull up their toy problems for a starting point.

## Broken Problems

Everyone of these problems does not work. With each one you can solve it by only modifying existing lines, there is not a need to write more lines of code. This is could be a good starting place for teaching the scientific method.

## Teaching topics

This is a list of topics I want to teach and to find a toy problem that focuses on teaching each one specificaly. I just felt like our toy problems most of the time end up just being the same things over and over. This ensures variety.

This is in no way a compleate or finished list. if there is a () next to the title then it was a brief idea of a toy problem that could help teach that topic

<li>for loop to modify data (map)</li>
<li>nested objects (my bob ross family tree)</li>
<li>an array of objects</li>
<li>while loop / do while</li>
<li>for in/square brackets (loop through every property)</li>
<li>for of (alternative for loop for arrays)</li>
<li>switch (looking for vowels)</li>
<li>if and / or (if male and 18)</li>
<li>higher order functions</li>
<li>double for loop</li>
